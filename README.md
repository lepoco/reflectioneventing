# üöé ReflectionEventing

[Created with ‚ù§ in Poland by lepo.co](https://dev.lepo.co/)  
Unleash the power of decoupled design with eventing. ReflectionEventing empowers developers to create simple events between services using DI in WPF, WinForms, or CLI applications. By facilitating better Inversion of Control, ReflectionEventing helps reduce coupling, enhancing the modularity and flexibility of your applications.

## üëÄ What does this repo contain?

The repository contains NuGet package source code, which uses C# reflection to register services that can be used to listen for local events.

## Gettings started

ReflectionEventing is available as NuGet package on NuGet.org:  
https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReflectionEventing

You can add it to your project using .NET CLI:

```powershell
dotnet add package ReflectionEventing
```

, or package manager console:

```powershell
NuGet\Install-Package ReflectionEventing
```

Publish your event

```csharp
public class MyService(IEventBus eventBus)
{
    public void PublishEvent()
    {
        eventBus.Publish(new MyEvent());
    }
}
```

You can listen for the event

```csharp
public partial class MainWindowViewModel : ObservableObject, IConsumer<BackgroundTicked>
{
    [ObservableProperty]
    private int _currentTick = 0;

    public Task ConsumeAsync(BackgroundTicked payload, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        CurrentTick = payload.Value;

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```
