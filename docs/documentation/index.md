## Overview

The Reflection Eventing library provides a flexible and powerful way to handle events in your application. It allows you to define event consumers, configure event buses, and manage event processing with ease.

### Key Features

- **EventBusBuilder**: A class to configure and build an event bus with a specific set of consumers.
- **Consumers**: Define consumers that handle specific event types.
- **Configuration Options**: Various options to control the behavior of the event bus, including event polymorphism, background queues, and error handling.
- **Error Handling**: Mechanisms to handle events that fail processing, including the use of error queues.

## Getting Started
