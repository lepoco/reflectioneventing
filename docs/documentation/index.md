# Reflection Eventing Docs

[Created with ‚ù§ in Poland by lepo.co](https://dev.lepo.co/)  
ReflectionEventing is a powerful tool for developers looking to create decoupled designs in WPF, WinForms, or CLI applications. By leveraging the power of Dependency Injection (DI) and eventing, ReflectionEventing promotes better Inversion of Control (IoC), reducing coupling and enhancing the modularity and flexibility of your applications.

## üëÄ What does this repo contain?

This repository houses the source code for the ReflectionEventing NuGet package. The package utilizes C# reflection to register services that can listen for and respond to local events.

## üõü Support plans

To ensure you receive the expert guidance you need, we offer a variety of support plans designed to meet the diverse needs of our community. Whether you are looking to in memory eventing or need assistance with our other libraries, our tailored support solutions are here to help. From priority email support to 24/7 dedicated assistance, we provide flexible plans to suit your project requirements.

## Gettings started

ReflectionEventing is available as NuGet package on NuGet.org:  
<https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReflectionEventing>  
<https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReflectionEventing.Autofac>  
<https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReflectionEventing.Castle.Windsor>  
<https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReflectionEventing.DependencyInjection>  
<https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReflectionEventing.Ninject>  
<https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReflectionEventing.Unity>

You can add it to your project using .NET CLI:

```powershell
dotnet add package ReflectionEventing.DependencyInjection
```

, or package manager console:

```powershell
NuGet\Install-Package ReflectionEventing.DependencyInjection
```

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Use ReflectionEventing

#### 1. Register Consumers and the Event Bus

In this step, we register our ViewModel as a singleton and add it as a consumer to the event bus. This allows the ViewModel to listen for events published on the bus.

```csharp
IHost host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()
  .ConfigureServices((context, services) =>
    {
      services.AddSingleton<MainWindowViewModel>();
      services.AddEventBus(e =>
      {
        e.AddConsumer<MainWindowViewModel>();
      });
    }
  )
  .Build();
```

#### 2. Publish Events

Here, we create a background service that publishes an event on the event bus. This event could be anything - in this case, we're publishing a `BackgroundTicked` event.

```csharp
public class MyBackgroundService(IEventBus eventBus)
{
    public void PublishEvent()
    {
        eventBus.Publish(new BackgroundTicked());
    }
}
```

#### 3. Listen for Events

Finally, we implement the `IConsumer<T>` interface in our ViewModel. This allows the ViewModel to consume `BackgroundTicked` events. When a `BackgroundTicked` event is published, the `ConsumeAsync` method is called, and we update the `CurrentTick` property.

```csharp
public partial class MainWindowViewModel : ObservableObject, IConsumer<BackgroundTicked>
{
    [ObservableProperty]
    private int _currentTick = 0;

    public Task ConsumeAsync(BackgroundTicked payload, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        CurrentTick = payload.Value;

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```
